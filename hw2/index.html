<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
  In this homework, we built our way up from the bottom, starting with implementing regular bezier curves using Casteljau’s algorithm. We then extended it to Bezier surfaces by using linear interpolation techniques. We then worked on adding smooth shading to our surfaces using area-weighted vertex normals. Finally, we implemented edge flip and split operations that could be used to modify objects or use them in the upsample function. 
  We had a lot of fun navigating the puzzle like structure of edges, half-edges, vertices, and more. When we were implementing edge flip and split, it almost felt like a game where we had to get from point A to point B correctly.
  We also enjoyed debugging and finding out why certain mistakes in our code created such interesting shapes.
  Overall, we had a great learning experience going from 2D to 3D objects and implementing the necessary operations to do so along the way.

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>


<b>
  Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
</b>
<p>
  Casteljau’s algorithm involves repeatedly using linear interpolation to find intermediate points from a vector of existing points. This creates subdivisions of the vectors and we repeat it until we arrive at a single point. We implemented it by creating a for loop that loops through n - 1 points of the given vector, and we use the formula from Casteljau’s algorithm, taking the ith and the ith + 1 to create a new point called pi’, which we then store into a new vector.

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.
</b>
<p>
  We were able to extend Casteljau’s algorithm to Bezier surfaces by taking advantage of the fact that we can use u and v as parameters for linear interpolation (for parameter t). Bezier surfaces consist of rows of points, which we can apply Casteljau’s algorithm with parameter u to each row to reduce them down to 3D Vectors in u. Then, with the resulting 3D Vectors in u, we can once again apply Casteljau’s algorithm with parameter v to find the 3D Vector that lies on the Bezier surface. This is essentially how we implemented it. In our evaluate function, we grabbed each row of points from control points and put it into evaluate1D, which iteratively used Casteljau’s algorithm with parameter u (in evaluateStep), creating an array of 3D vectors. With the array of 3D Vectors, we once again called evaluate1D with parameter v, which returned us the final 3D Vector.

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
</b>
<p>
  Essentially, we found each face by iterating through the half edges. We found the vertices associated with each face and then created vectors that pointed to each other, called v01 and v02. Then, we found the normal by taking the cross product of these 2 vectors. We then computed the area by taking 0.5 x the magnitude of the cross product. From here, we computed the area weighted normal for this face. We repeated this for each face. Finally, we summed all the area weight normals up and then normalized the vector.

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Edge Flip</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
  We first drew out a diagram displaying before and after a flip operation that contained all the edges, half edges, vertices, and faces labeled. Then, we assigned them all in our program. Next, we set the half edges for the vertex, edge, and faces. Finally, we set all the half edges neighbor data. We had one issue where some of the neighboring edges disappeared after we flipped an edge, but we realized that it was because we forgot to set the half edge pointer for each vertex, edge, and face.

<p>
  For the issue with disappearing edges, we realized that they were collapsing with other edges. So we hovered over the edges to finally realize that the half-edges associated to the edges were wrong, and that’s why the edges moved with the half-edges as they moved. This led us to debug that we didn’t individually change the half edges for the vertex, edge, and face.
</p>
<br>


<h3 align="middle">Part 5: Edge Split</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge split operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
  Similar to part 4, we drew out a diagram of the modified mesh that added new elements. We then assigned these elements in our code. If the element did not exist before, we created the new mesh element. We set all half edges for the vertex, edge, and faces. We then set all the half edges neighbor data. We had one issue where splitting a certain edge followed by another split resulted in a missing triangle. We found out that it was because we accidentally set the twin of one edge wrong.

    Write about your eventful debugging journey, if you have experienced one.

<p>
  For the issue of the disappearing triangle, we noticed that when we clicked on a certain vertex after splitting, it caused the program to crash. We isolated it to the vertex C that was causing the crash and then found all the lines that were related to vertex C. That is how we found that the twin of one half edge was set wrong.

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
  We implemented loop subdivision using several steps. First we calculated all the new positions of all the existing vertices in the mesh by going through each vertex with a for loop, using the formula (1 - n * u) * original_position + u * original_neighbor_position_sum, and setting the vertex’s new position to the newly calculated position. Then we calculated the updated vertex positions associated with the edges by going through each edge in the mesh, finding the neighboring vertices a b c d, and finding the new position with the given formula. We then went through and got all the original edges in the mesh. We went through all these original edges and split them. Then we flipped only the new edges (or blue edges) that connected an old and new vertex. Finally, we updated the position’s with their respective new position attributes. We had an issue where the surrounding vertices of an edge weren’t being accessed correctly and we realized we had to get the half edge associated with that edge first and then find vertices from there. We used plenty of print statements to see which conditions weren't being met properly. 
</p>
<br>


<b>
  Take some notes, as well as some screenshots, of your observations on how meshes behave after loop subdivision. What happens to sharp corners and edges? Can you reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges?
</b>
<p>
  We noticed that the sharp corners and edges were eventually rounded out, almost as if they were sanded down. This might be due to the fact that we are averaging points with its neighbors, which makes sense why it “rounds out.” It is possible to reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges so that the new positions won’t be as far because splitting on a sharp edge will make them closer. We confirmed this by splitting over the same sharp edge multiple times.

<b>
  Load dae/cube.dae. Perform several iterations of loop subdivision on the cube. Notice that the cube becomes slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions. Can you pre-process the cube with edge flips and splits so that the cube subdivides symmetrically? Document these effects and explain why they occur. Also explain how your pre-processing helps alleviate the effects.
</b>
<p>
  It is possible to maintain the symmetry of the cube by preprocessing the cube with splits and flips. The asymmetry occurs after several iterations of subdivision because having one edge on each face which was slanted a certain direction would cause an uneven distribution of new triangles on each face. By splitting each edge on all the faces, we now have 4 edges on each face. We can then properly maintain the symmetry when splitting because we first make sure that the cube is symmetrical to begin with before doing subdivision.
